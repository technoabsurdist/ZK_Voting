## Solution

1. dApp users get certain specified voting rights for their accounts

<!-- 2. Users create unique secret as secret = hash(address,salt1) and publish account_hash = hash(secret, salt2) at the smart contract. Also, users publish snark proof, that the computation is correct. This procedure can be executed only once for each account with voting rights. -->

<!-- 3. Users can anonymously not exclusively delegate their voting rights to another account, publishing a snark with multiple existed account_hash public input, new account_hash public output (corresponding to the same secret, but another salt) and private selector of one of the inputted accounts. -->

<!-- 4. Users publish encrypted via counters private key message = {voting_vector, secret} and snark proof that message is correct and encryption is correct. -->

<!-- 5. After the end of voting counters MapReduce all messages from last to first via snarks without publishing any subtotals. If the secret is new, we increment subtotal vector and add the secret to set of known secrets during the counting (how to do it is described here ). If the secret is not new, we pass the addition and just update the state's salt to hide from others that the secret is not new here. -->

<!-- 6. After the end of the counting, the resulting vector is published with proof. -->

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
